# MEASURING-LAYERWISE-PERFORMANCE

## This Content was Created by Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers UDACITY Nanodegree.

Use the get_perf_counts API available in OpenVINO to get the performance of each layer in our model. By identifying the bottlenecks in our models performance, we can then remove,
or change those layers to make our model inference time faster.
